# Build status

Version: **0.4.5-beta.30**

## Implemented

- Portable C++ WorldGen core and tests
- Python package and tests
- Exact BDS 1.26.33 / Endstone v0.11.6 adapter source
- Native `ChunkSource` request interception pipeline
- Detached worker processing and primary-thread commits
- Deterministic native install and packaging scripts
- GitHub Actions Windows x64 and Linux x64 exact builds for BDS 1.26.33
- Downloadable workflow artifacts on every push
- Automatic tagged GitHub Releases
- Raw plugin, ZIP package, manifest, and SHA-256 outputs
- Verified Endstone 0.11 command-test wheel and native status bridge packaging
- Build-time rejection of unresolved Bedrock ABI symbols and release-time RPATH validation

## Validation boundary

Portable builds and package tooling are validated locally. Exact native binaries are compiled by the included GitHub Actions runners and still require first-load testing against the matching BDS executable before production use.

## GitHub Actions toolchain hotfix

- Linux exact builds run on Ubuntu 22.04 with Clang 18 and libc++ 18.
- Both platforms invoke `scripts/build_exact.py`, so executable-bit loss cannot cause exit code 126.
- Windows exact builds use clang-cl, lld-link, and Ninja inside the Visual Studio 2022 developer environment.
- Failed exact jobs upload CMake diagnostics for inspection.
